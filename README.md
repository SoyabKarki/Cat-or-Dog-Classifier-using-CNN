# Cat or Dog Classifier using CNN

## Project Description
This project is a simple implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either a cat or a dog. The model was trained using a 2000-image dataset of cat and dog images.

### Prerequisites
The following libraries are required to run this project:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

### Dataset

### Model
The model is built using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. Training is conducted on the training data over 5 epochs, utilizing a batch size of 64.

### Performance 
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 79% after training for 5 epochs.
